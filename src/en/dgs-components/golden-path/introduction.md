# What is the Golden Path?

The **Golden Path** is a project scaffold created by the engineering team to simplify the creation of new projects within DB1.

It consists of three applications:

- **Frontend** - React  
- **Backend** - .NET Core 8  
- **Keycloak** - Authentication server  

This project comes with a ready-made folder and file structure, initial configurations for each application, and a pre-configured user and permission structure in Keycloak.

The user and permission structure includes example users and groups with access permissions for each application.  

However, you can customize this structure to suit your project's needs.

## Evolution of the Golden Path
### It is your responsibility to contribute to the Golden Path

The **Golden Path** is a living project, meaning it is constantly evolving.  
<br>
It is **HIGHLY RECOMMENDED** that with every new project you create using it, you help improve the Golden Path by reporting bugs, suggesting improvements, and even contributing code.
