# The DB1 Way for QA

In defining the DB1 Way of Quality Assurance (QA), we recognize that this documentation is more than a set of processes; it represents a commitment to delivering high-quality software that continuously adds value for our clients.

Just as our software engineering is metrics-driven, so is our QA, with a data-driven way to guide decisions and foster ongoing improvements.

## Our Vision of Quality

**What is the main measure of progress for QA?**

It is the confidence in software that meets client requirements without compromising functionality, security, or performance. DB1 QA prioritizes ensuring that each delivery adds value and meets client expectations, aligned with the Agile Manifesto.

## Principles of the DB1 Way for QA

1. **Consistent and Iterative Quality:** We deliver quality continuously, promoting testing at all stages of development and welcoming changes to quality requirements, as we know they are opportunities to evolve and offer a competitive advantage to the client.

2. **Technical Excellence in Testing:** We believe that attention to technical excellence in testing and the use of best practices enhance agility. Our approach spans from applying manual testing techniques at a functional level to automating these tests and constantly monitoring defects and failure patterns, ensuring our team can react and improve continuously.

## Quality Metrics and Tools

- We maintain an agile flow for triaging and monitoring defect resolution to ensure swift corrections and prevent recurrence of issues.
- We value testing at all stages, automating whenever possible and quickly adapting to changes.
- We believe that manual and exploratory testing are essential for detecting subjective and unforeseen issues in automation.
- We utilize an internal tracking dashboard where we record the quality metrics of each project. This dashboard facilitates the identification of problematic areas and teams needing additional support.

| Index          | Perception                                                 | 
|----------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|
| >= 80% Healthy  | System with controlled quality and high coverage and monitoring. |
| >= 60% and <80% Moderate | Attention needed to avoid regression and monitor indicators suggesting potential degradation. |
| < 60% Critical  | Requires urgent intervention for process adjustments and test coverage. |

## QA Responsibility and Commitment

We have the responsibility to keep quality indicators high and promote a culture of continuous improvement. We do this through technical review sessions (chapter reviews), where we discuss and evaluate QA best practices and share knowledge to strengthen the team as a whole.

Poor software maintenance is costly, both in terms of time and money. The "DB1 Way for QA" aims not only to ensure quality but also to protect our clients' investment, delivering value and trust with every new software release.
